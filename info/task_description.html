    Tic-Tac-Toe, sometimes also known as Xs and Os, is a game for two players
    (X and O) who take turns marking the spaces in a 3×3 grid.
    The player who succeeds in placing three respective marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal
    rows (NW-SE and
    NE-SW) wins the game. Maybe you've solve <a

    Here you will play versus various bots and your mission is don't lose. Only wins or draws.
    For each game your function is called several times (in the same environment)
    for each move until game over.
</p>
<p>
    For each step your function receive a grid state as a sequence of strings, where
    "X" is X-mark, "O" is O-mark and "." is an empty cell. The second argument is a your mark - "X"
    or "O". For each move your fuтction should return coordinates of the your next mark as
    a sequence of two numbers - row and column. Rows and columns arecounted from zero.

<p><strong>Precondition:</strong><br>
    len(grid) == 3<br>
    all(all(ch in "XO." for ch in row) and len(row) == 3 for row in grid)
